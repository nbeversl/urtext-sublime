Thanks for trying out Urtext.

Urtext is a syntax and interpreter for writing, connecting and organizing text. It is for prose writing, research, documentation, journaling, project organization, notetaking, and any other writing or information management that can be done in text form. 

Urtext itself (a standalone Python module) does not have a user interface and must be wrapped in a text editor. This package is an implementation for desktop (PC/Mac/Linux) using Sublime Text. 

The documentation of Urtext is itself an Urtext project at https://github.com/nbeversl/urtext-docs. You can read it in directly on Github or download it as a navigable project.
